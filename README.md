🎮<b> How to Play</b>

The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
Players alternate between placing X and O by clicking on empty squares.
The goal is to get three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
If a player wins, the game will display a "Winner!" message 🏅.
If all squares are filled without a winner, the game will end in a tie 🤝.
You can reset the game anytime by clicking the Restart button 🔄.
