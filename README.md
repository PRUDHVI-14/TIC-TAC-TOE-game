🎮<b> How to Play</b>

The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.<br>

The goal is to get three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.<br>
If a player wins, the game will display a "Winner!" message 🏅.<br>
If all squares are filled without a winner, the game will end in a tie 🤝.<br>
You can reset the game anytime by clicking the Restart button 🔄.<br>
